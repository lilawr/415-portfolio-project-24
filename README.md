# PROJECT TITLE 


## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
This project looks at the potential for hyperparameter optimisation to improve the performance of a wine
quality classifier model.


""include a 100-word description of what your model is doing, outlining your results to a general audience.
## DATA
"" A summary of the data you’re using, remembering to include where you got it and any relevant citations. 

The data used is a data set from Kaggle about wine with physicochemical test result data about a certain set of Vinho Verde wines and the quality ratings from drinkers sensory feedback.

## MODEL 
This task is the classify the wines by quality rating from 1-10 from the given inputs

"" A summary of the model you’re using and why you chose it. 

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMISATION
""Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them. 

## RESULTS
""A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model
