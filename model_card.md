## Model Description

**Input:** 
11 physicochemical numerical properties of wine: 0 - fixed acidity, 1 - volatile acidity, 2 - citric acid, 3 - residual sugar, 4 - chlorides, 5 - free sulfur dioxide, 6 - total sulfur dioxide, 7 - density, 8 - pH, 9 - sulphates, 10 - alcohol

**Output:** 
1 numerical wine quality rating between 0 and 10

**Model Architecture:** Describe the model architecture youâ€™ve used
